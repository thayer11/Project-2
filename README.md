Backcountry skiers rely heavily on a combination of data to help them avoid potential avalanches. Terrain, snow pack, weather, and human error all factor into the decision making process. This app will allow skiers to record and share any avalanche that has occured in a specific area and the conditions surrounding the event. By crowdsourcing skiers will be better informed and more able to make safe backcountry decisions.

This app will use Google Maps to pinpoint locations.

The user will be able to filter avalanche by date, state, and specific location.

The user will also be able to record general observations such as observed weak layers or strange wind events in the spirit of prevention.  

The user will enter personal information such as credentials and affiliations.
